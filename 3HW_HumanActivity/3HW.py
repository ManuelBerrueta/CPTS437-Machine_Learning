'''First, write code to calculate accuracy and a macro f-measure using 3-fold
 cross validation for two classifiers: a majority classifier and a decision tree
  classifier. You can use the sklearn libraries for the classifiers but write
   your own code to perform cross validation and calculation of the
    performance measures.'''

'''Second, provide your observations on the results. Why do the two performance
 measures provide such different results? Why do the two classifiers perform
  so differently on this task?'''


'''Third, write code to generate and plot an ROC curve
 (containing at least 10 points). Generate two ROC curves, one based on a
  decision tree classifier with a depth bound of 2 and one with an unbounded
   decision tree. You can use the sklearn predict_proba function to provide a
    probability distribution over the class values, but create your own
     ROC curve rather than using the sklearn roc_curve function. Ideally you
      would generate the ROC curve on a holdout subset of data, but for
       simplicity in this case you can build it using the entire dataset.'''
